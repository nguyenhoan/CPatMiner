Prior research exploited the repetitiveness of code changes to enable
several tasks such as code completion, bug-fix recommendation,
library adaption, etc. These and other novel applications require
accurate automated detection of repetitive changes, but the current
state-of-the-art is limited to custom-tailored algorithms that detect
specific kinds of changes at the syntactic level. Existing algorithms
relying on syntactic similarity have lower accuracy, and cannot 
effectively detect semantic change patterns. In this work, we introduce
a novel graph-based mining approach, CPatMiner, to detect previously 
unknown repetitive changes in the wild, by mining fine-grained
semantic code change patterns from a large number of open-source
repositories. To overcome unique challenges such as detecting meaningful 
change patterns and scaling to large repositories, we rely on
fine-grained change graphs that capture program dependencies.
</p>
<p>
We evaluate CPatMiner by mining change patterns in a diverse
corpus of 5,000+ open-source projects from GitHub across a population 
of 170,000+ developers. We use three complementary methods.
First, we sent the mined patterns to 108 open-source developers.
We found that 70% of respondents recognized those patterns as
their meaningful frequent changes. Moreover, 79% of respondents
even named the patterns, and 44% wanted future IDEs to automate
such repetitive changes. We found that the mined change patterns
belong to various development activities: adaptive (9%), perfective
(20%), corrective (35%) and preventive (36%, including all refactorings). 
Second, we compared CPatMiner with the state-of-the-art,
AST-based technique, and reported that CPatMiner detects 37 %
more meangingful patterns. Third, we use CPatMiner to search
for patterns in a corpus of 88 GitHub projects with longer histories
consisting of 164M SLOCs. It constructed 322K fine-grained change
graphs containing 3M nodes, and detected 17K instances of change
patterns from which we provide unique insights on the practice of
change patterns among individuals and teams. We found that a large
percentage (75%) of the change patterns from individual developers
are commonly shared with others, and this holds true for teams.
Moreover, we found that the patterns are not intermittent but spread
widely over time. Thus, we call for a community-based change pattern 
database to provide important resources in novel applications.</p>
